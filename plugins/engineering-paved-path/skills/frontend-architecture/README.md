# frontend-architecture

**Version 1.0.0**

A skill about **where frontend code goes**: component placement and splitting, colocation versus
shared folders, constants, utilities, types, styles, tests, which layer owns business logic and
data access, and where the Server/Client Component boundary sits in the Next.js App Router.

Architecture and code organisation only. Performance is deliberately excluded.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | 13 placement rules, each with ✓/✗, plus the split-a-component signals |
| `references/file-layout.md` | What goes where; three canonical layouts and where each breaks; promotion rule; barrels; naming; import paths |
| `references/component-boundaries.md` | When to split, composition over configuration, slots, container/presentational |
| `references/logic-layers.md` | Pure functions → hooks → components; API client; key registries; state ownership |
| `references/nextjs-app-router.md` | Private folders, route groups, client boundary, the three data-handling models, DAL, server actions, loading/error boundaries |
| `references/enforcement.md` | Lint and build-time configuration that makes the rules non-optional |

## Relationship to the neighbouring skills

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| **frontend-architecture** (this one) | where a file goes, which layer owns what, where boundaries sit |
| `engineering-paved-path:layered-architecture` | the same question on the server side |
| What happens inside a component: derived state, `useEffect`, memoisation, keys, accessibility | a React practice skill — not published in this plugin |
| Next.js APIs, metadata, image and font handling, bundling | a Next.js practice skill — not published in this plugin |
| How to write the test once you know where it lives | a testing skill — not published in this plugin |

There is intentionally no overlap. When a question is about placement, this skill answers it; when
it is about the code inside the file, it says so and hands the question back. The unpublished
neighbours are named so the boundary stays legible; do not answer their questions in their
absence.

## Changelog

### 1.0.0 — initial

- 13 placement rules, five reference files, this bibliography.
- Positions taken on contested questions: one organising axis rather than a prescribed layout; the
  rule of two for promotion; per-component barrels only; a global `types/` folder rejected for
  domain models; state placed by ownership rather than by convenience.
- Extracted into `engineering-paved-path`. The rules were already repository-agnostic; what was
  removed is the profile file describing one repository's local dialect, which stayed with that
  repository. Rule 4 of "How to use" now points at whatever conventions the host has instead.

Bump the minor version when a rule is added or a position changes; bump the patch version for
clarifications and new sources. Record the reason here — a skill whose rules change without a trace
cannot be trusted by the sessions that already followed the old ones.

## Evaluations

Three scenarios, each run in a fresh session with this skill loaded. They exist so the next version
is measured against the same bar.

1. **Placement.** *"Add a component rendered only on one detail page."*
   Expected: created beside the route that owns it, as a folder whose files appear only if their
   content does; no client directive when the parent subtree already carries one; no promotion to
   a shared components folder for a single consumer (rules 1, 2, 3, 10).

2. **Layering.** *"We need to call a new read endpoint from the UI."*
   Expected: the call goes behind a hook or a data-access function, with a cache key that includes
   every parameter affecting the response; zero `fetch` in a component body (rules 5, 7, 8).

3. **Premature promotion.** *"Move this sorting function into shared utilities."*
   Expected: pushback via the rule of two — with one consumer it stays in the colocated helpers
   file; promotion happens when a second branch of the tree needs it (rules 2, 4).

**Regression check.** In the same session, ask a memoisation question. This skill should hand it
back as out of scope rather than answering it.

Each scenario is stated without naming a directory this skill does not own. A repository whose
conventions differ should expect the rule numbers above, not the exact paths.

- [Next.js — Project structure and organization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure) —
  colocation, private `_folders`, route groups, the `src` folder, and the three supported
  organisation strategies (outside `app`, inside `app`, split by feature or route).

  when to use each, `'use client'` as a module-graph boundary, passing server components as
  `children`, provider placement, `server-only` / `client-only`.
- [Next.js — How to Think About Security in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions) —
  the three data-handling models, the Data Access Layer, DTOs, taint APIs, treating server-action
  arguments as hostile, and the audit checklist.

  inside the data layer.
- [React — Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) — one component, one

  under 500 lines, references one level deep, a table of contents in files over 100 lines, no
  time-sensitive content.

### Reference architectures

### Colocation and file layout

- [Kent C. Dodds — Colocation](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation) — "place code as close to
  where it's relevant as possible"; the orphaned-utility cost; the explicit carve-out for
  end-to-end tests and system-wide documentation.

  the progression from flat to feature to domain folders, and the promotion rule for utilities.

  the by-function counter-position, kept in the skill as a deliberate contrast rather than
  suppressed.
- [tkdodo — Please stop using barrel files](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/please-stop-using-barrel-files) —
  circular imports through barrels, the 11k → 3.5k module reduction, and the one case where a
  barrel is justified.

  barrel behaviour in the App Router.
- [Screaming architecture in front-end](https://medium.com/@hrynkevych/screaming-architecture-in-front-end-de72d9ec961c) —
  folders named for the domain, not for the technology.

### Component boundaries and composition

  composition over configuration, lifting content up, slots.
- [patterns.dev — Container/Presentational](https://www.patterns.dev/react/presentational-container-pattern/) —

  hooks as the application-logic layer between pure functions and components.
- [TanStack Query — Does this replace client state?](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/guides/does-this-replace-client-state) —
  server state versus client state, and why copying responses into a store is the common mistake.
- [Total TypeScript — Where to put your types](https://www.totaltypescript.com/where-to-put-your-types-in-application-code) —
  inline, then colocated, then shared; resist premature extraction.
- [Where your types live matters](https://blog.serghei.pl/posts/where-your-types-live-matters/) —
  domain types inside features; `types/` reserved for ambient declarations.
