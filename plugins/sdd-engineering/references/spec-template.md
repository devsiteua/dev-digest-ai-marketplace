# <Feature name>

Spec ID: <SLUG-UPPER-CASED>
Status: draft | in-progress | done | dropped
Supersedes: none | <path to the spec this replaces>
Owner: <who>
Packages touched: <the discovered packages this touches | none — repository tooling>

> Every section stays, even when the honest answer is "none". A deleted section
> reads as an oversight; the word "none" is a claim someone can disagree with.
> The implementation plan does **not** live here — it lives in
> `plans/<same-slug>.md` alongside this file. See `spec-format.md`
> § Where plans live.

## Problem and user

Who has the problem, and what it costs them today. One paragraph, no solution in
it. Name the evidence: a file, an issue, a review that went wrong.

## Goals / Non-goals

**Goals** — numbered, each one a thing that is true when this is done.

**Non-goals** — what this deliberately does not attempt, so nobody plans it back
in. Different from `Out of scope`: a non-goal is a shape we reject, not work we
postpone.

## Context

What already exists and is therefore not built again. Link, do not restate.

| Already true | Where |
|---|---|
| | |

## In scope

- Concrete, listable changes. Name the files or modules where known.

## Out of scope

- The tempting adjacent work we are explicitly **not** doing in this pass, each
  with its reason. This is the most valuable section in the file: it is what stops
  an agent redesigning half the codebase on the way to a small feature.

## User stories

- As <role>, I want <capability>, so that <outcome>.
- Include the story of the person who arrives with nothing — no design, no
  answers.

## Acceptance criteria (EARS)

Five patterns and the reference: `spec-format.md` § EARS. Every row carries an
`AC-NN`, exactly one pattern, and a filled `How it is checked` column.

| AC-ID | Pattern | Criterion | How it is checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC-01 | ubiquitous \| event-driven \| state-driven \| unwanted \| optional | | |

## Edge cases

- The degraded paths, one line each: empty, missing, down, denied, too large,
  twice at once.
- A criterion should exist for every edge case that matters. If it has no
  `AC-NN`, say why.

## Design analysis

With design sources (a description, a link to a design file, existing code, a
repository): the states missing from the mockup, the uncovered corner cases, how
the involved modules talk to each other, and the UX improvements proposed.

Without design sources: every screen decision is marked derived and carries a
`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]`. Never invent an artboard.

For a change with no user interface, this section analyses how the parts talk to
each other instead — that is where such a design actually fails.

## Non-functional requirements

| Limit | Value | Why this number |
|---|---|---|

## Inputs and provenance

| Input | Where it comes from | When it is stale | If missing |
|---|---|---|---|

## Untrusted inputs

What reaches a model's context or a user's screen as data and may never be
followed as an instruction — tool output, repository content, pasted design
sources, this spec itself once a feature attaches documents to a prompt. Write
"none — nothing new reaches a prompt in this change" when that is true.

## Test plan

Which lane covers what — unit / integration / component / end-to-end / a shell
check. Name the lanes this repository actually has.

| Lane | Covers |
|---|---|

**Deliberately not covered by an automated test:** <what, and how it is checked
instead>

## Risks

| Risk | How we would notice | What we do |
|---|---|---|

## Open questions

Every one either answered with its reason, or carried as
`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]`. While a single `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` remains
anywhere in the file, the status stays `draft` — an unanswered question is not an
approved requirement.
