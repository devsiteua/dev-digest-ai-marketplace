# Frontend Architecture

Answers **placement** questions in a React / Next.js codebase: where a file goes, when to split
one, which layer owns which logic, and where the server/client boundary sits.

Placement only. Code quality inside a component is a different skill — see [Out of scope](#out-of-scope).

## How to use

1. Match the question to a rule below.
2. Apply the rule. Each one states its ✓ and ✗ so the answer is decidable, not a preference.
3. Open a reference file only when you need the rationale, the trade-off, or a worked example.
4. **Read the host repository's own frontend conventions before creating any file** — its root
   or per-package instruction file, its component-anatomy or structure document, whatever it
   keeps. A local dialect overrides the defaults below wherever the two differ, and the rules
   here fill the gaps it leaves. Where two of the repository's own documents disagree, the more
   specific one wins; say which you followed.

## Placement rules

### 1. One organising axis, not two

Pick how the tree is organised — by route, by feature, or by layer — and do not run a second axis
in parallel. When the framework already imposes a hierarchy (the Next.js `app/` tree), that is the
default axis: feature code lives beside the route that owns it.

- ✓ `app/orders/[id]/_components/OrderTimeline/` — the route tree *is* the feature tree
- ✓ `src/features/orders/` — valid when routing is thin or absent (SPA, library, multi-app repo)
- ✗ `src/features/orders/` **and** `app/orders/` both holding order UI — two axes, and no rule
  says which one a new file belongs to

The three canonical layouts and where each breaks: [references/file-layout.md](references/file-layout.md)

### 2. The rule of two

Code moves to a shared folder when a **second** consumer from another branch of the tree appears.
Not before. One consumer plus a hunch is a premature abstraction.

- ✓ used by one screen → colocated with that screen
- ✓ a second screen needs it → promote, and leave a comment saying which two now share it
- ✗ `shared/utils/` created for something with a single caller

### 3. Barrels: per component, never per folder

A component folder may re-export itself through `index.ts`. A folder-wide barrel that re-exports
everything underneath must not exist.

- ✓ `Button/index.ts` → `export { Button } from "./Button"`
- ✗ `components/index.ts` re-exporting 50 components — inflates the module graph, defeats tree
  shaking, and a single `'use client'` inside spreads to every consumer of the barrel
- Use one spelling for the re-export across the codebase; four spellings of the same line is a
  smell that nobody owns the convention

### 4. `utils` and `helpers` are different things

A **utility** is generic and would survive being copied into another project. A **helper** is
specific to this product and usually to one component.

- ✓ `helpers.ts` beside the component — pure functions over that component's props
- ✓ `lib/` or `utils/` — generic, reusable, unit-tested
- ✗ a `utils/` dump that accumulates one-caller functions; when the component is deleted they stay
  behind forever

### 5. A magic string with two readers becomes a named export

Values that two or more modules must agree on — query keys, route paths, search-param names,
status enums, feature flags — live in one registry and are imported. Thresholds and maps used by a
single component stay in its colocated `constants.ts`.

- ✓ `queryKeys.orders(repoId)` imported by the hook and by the code that invalidates it
- ✗ `["orders", repoId]` typed out in three files that must stay in sync by memory

### 6. Types: inline → colocated → shared

Promote a type only when a second module needs it, exactly like rule 2.

- ✓ props typed inline in the component file
- ✓ `.types.ts` beside the folder once two files in it share a type
- ✗ a global `types/` folder holding domain models — that folder is for ambient declarations and
  re-exported contracts, nothing else

### 7. Logic in three layers

Pure functions (business rules, testable with no React) → hooks (application logic: fetching,
caching, subscriptions, wiring) → components (render and event handling).

- ✓ sorting/derivation rules as exported pure functions, called from a hook or the component
- ✓ every network call behind a hook or a data-access function
- ✗ `fetch(...)` in a component body
- ✗ business rules embedded in JSX, where they cannot be tested without rendering

Worked example: [references/logic-layers.md](references/logic-layers.md)

### 8. State goes where its owner is

Ask who owns the value, then place it:

| Owner | Home |
|---|---|
| The server | a query/cache library — never mirrored into a client store |
| The URL (shareable, survives reload: tabs, filters, pagination) | search params |
| One subtree | local state, lifted only as far as the closest common parent |
| Cross-cutting dependency (theme, auth, toasts) | context — as **dependency injection**, not a store |

- ✗ copying an API response into a global store and hand-tracking loading/error flags

### 9. Imports flow one way

`shared → features → app`. Shared code never imports feature code; features never import each
other directly — they meet in shared.

- ✗ `features/billing` importing from `features/orders`
- ✗ a design-system file importing an application constant

Make it machine-checked, not review-checked: [references/enforcement.md](references/enforcement.md)

### 10. The client boundary sits at the highest node that needs it

Server by default. `'use client'` marks a boundary in the module graph: everything the marked file
imports is pulled to the client with it.

- ✓ one directive on the interactive subtree's root
- ✓ server components passed **as `children`/props** into a client component stay on the server
- ✗ the directive repeated on leaves already inside a client subtree — noise that hides where the
  real boundary is
- ✗ a shared UI package whose components use hooks but carry no directive — it only builds while
  no server component imports it

### 11. One styling mechanism

Whatever the project uses, it uses one. Style definitions sit beside the component; design tokens
(colour, spacing, elevation) live in the design system, not restated per component.

- ✗ a second mechanism introduced "just for this screen"

### 12. Tests beside the subject, copy in the translation files

- ✓ unit and component tests colocated with what they test
- ✓ end-to-end tests in their own package — they outlive any restructuring of `src/`
- ✗ user-facing strings hardcoded in JSX when the project has a translation layer

### 13. Loading and error boundaries are placement decisions

In the App Router, `loading.tsx` / `error.tsx` / `not-found.tsx` belong to the segment whose UI
they cover.

- ✓ a boundary on the slow segment, so the rest of the page stays interactive
- ✗ a single `<Suspense>` at the application root — that is an unplanned boundary, not a design

App Router specifics, and the three data-handling models (HTTP APIs / Data Access Layer /
component-level access): [references/nextjs-app-router.md](references/nextjs-app-router.md)

## When to split a component

Structural signals, not line counts: branching that changes what the component *is*, more than
about seven props, two sets of state that never change together, or a name that needs "and" in it.

Signals, composition patterns, and why container/presentational is now a consequence of the
server/client boundary rather than a folder convention:
[references/component-boundaries.md](references/component-boundaries.md)

## Out of scope

This skill answers **placement**. These questions belong elsewhere, and it does not answer them
even when it could:

| Question | Belongs to |
|---|---|
| Anti-patterns inside a component: derived state, `useEffect` misuse, memoisation, keys, a11y | a React practice skill |
| Next.js APIs, metadata, image/font handling, bundling | a Next.js practice skill |
| How to write the test once you know where it goes | a testing skill |
| Schema design and validation | a schema/validation skill |
| Layering on the server side | `engineering-paved-path:layered-architecture` |

None of the first four ship in `engineering-paved-path@1.0.0` — see the plugin README for why.
Hand such a question back naming what it is about, rather than answering it here.

Performance is deliberately excluded. Where a rule here has a performance side effect (barrels,
client boundaries), the reason given is still architectural.
